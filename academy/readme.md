### DHIS2 Academy Identity
---
These guidelines exist to ensure consistent communication with the DHIS2 and DHIS2 Academy brand. There are some rules and some recommendations. This is a living document that will be updated as the brand evolves. Please reach out if there are elements that are missing.

*Please note: The DHIS2 Academy Identity applies for both the DHIS2 Academies and the DHIS2 Online Academy. The academy type should be specified elsewhere in the text/website/information, not in the logo itself.*

# Logo
## Master Logo
![dhis2 Academy master logo][masterLogoAca]

The master DHIS2 Academy logo should be used overall, whenever possible. The master logo is a blue colored icon with black colored dhis2 wordmark and a grey colored Academy wordmark.

## Logo Variations
### Reversed Logo
![dhis2 Academy reversed logo][reversedLogoAca]

When placing the DHIS2 logo on a dark background, the reversed version can be used. The icon and wordmarks are white in this version. The reversed logo can be placed on any colored background, but ideally blue would be used to remain consistent with the DHIS2 brand.

### Icon Only
Where there is insufficient room for the full logo, use the Icon only version instead. This logo is supplied in the main [DHIS2 Identity Guidelines](https://github.com/dhis2/dhis2-identity#icon-only).


## Logo Usage
For guidance on usage of the logo, refer to the main [DHIS2 Identity guidelines](https://github.com/dhis2/dhis2-identity). The DHIS2 Academy logo should follow the same guidelines.
